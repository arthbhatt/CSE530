Open a terminal and navigate to this (EOSI-Bhatt-A-assgn01/part2) folder

How to make?
Run the Makefile command to generate the binaries for kernel module and the test program
To run the Makefile, type "make" in the terminal after navigating to this folder.

How to run?
1) Copy the binaries(namely rbt530_drv.ko, rbprobe_drv.ko, rbprobe_tester and rbt530_tester) to Intel Galileo Gen2 Board.
   To copy, you can use the scp command. For example,
	scp rbt530_drv.ko rbt530_tester rbprobe_drv.ko rbprobe_tester root@192.168.1.5:/home/root

2) Insert the kernel modules using insmod in the following order
	insmod /home/root/rbt530_drv.ko
	insmod /home/root/rbprove_drv.ko
   This will create two device files due to rbt530_drv in the /dev folder
	and one device file due to rbprove_drv.ko

3) Run rbt530_tester to test the device driver rbt530_drv.ko
	/home/root/rbt530_tester

4) Run rbprobe_tester to insert probes in rbt530.
	/home/root/rbprobe_tester /dev/rbprobe_dev <read_write_sel> <symbol_select> <reg_unreg_select> <offset>
		<read_write_sel> - Can be "read" or "write"
		If read_write_sel is set as "write" then three more parameters are to be passed:
			<symbol_select> - Can be 0 for rbt530_read OR 1 for rbt530_write
			<reg_unreg_select> - Can be 1 to register the probe OR 0 to unregister the probe
			<offset> - Set this to 0 for proper functioning

To remove the driver, type "rmmod <driver_filename>" in the terminal.

Thank you
