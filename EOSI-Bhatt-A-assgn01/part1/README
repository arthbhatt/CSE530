Open a terminal and navigate to this (EOSI-Bhatt-A-assgn01/part1) folder

How to make?
Run the Makefile command to generate the binaries for kernel module and the test program
To run the Makefile, type "make" in the terminal after navigating to this folder.

How to run?
1) Copy the binaries(namely rbt530_drv.ko and rbt530_tester) to Intel Galileo Gen2 Board.
   To copy, you can use the scp command. For example,
	scp rbt530_drv.ko rbt530_tester root@192.168.1.5:/home/root

2) Insert the kernel module using insmod
	insmod /home/root/rbt530_drv.ko
   This will create two device files in the /dev folder

3) Run rbt530_tester to test the device driver
	/home/root/rbt530_tester

To remove the driver, type "rmmod <driver_filename>" in the terminal.

Thank you
