Open a terminal and navigate to this (EOSI-Bhatt-A-assgn02/part2) folder

How to make?
Run the Makefile command to generate the binaries for kernel module and the test program
To run the Makefile, type "make" in the terminal after navigating to this folder.

How to run?
1) Copy the binaries(namely hcsr_of_driver.ko, hcsr_of_driver.ko) to Intel Galileo Gen2 Board.
   Also copy sysfs_test.sh to Intel Galileo Gen2 Board.
   To copy, you can use the scp command. For example,
	scp hcsr_of_driver.ko hcsr_of_driver.ko sysfs_test.sh root@192.168.1.5:/home/root

2) Insert the kernel module using insmod
	insmod hcsr_of_driver.ko
	insmod hcsr_of_device.ko
   This will generate sysfs interface in /sys/class/misc/ (Unable to create under /sys/class/HCSR/)
   More number of devices can be created by using device_count parameter

3) Run sysfs_test.sh to test the device driver
	Check if it is executable or not. If not then run the following command:
		chmod +x sysfs_test.sh

To remove the driver, type "rmmod hcsr_of_driver.ko" in the terminal.

Modifying the bash script:
At the start of the script, different parameters can be configure such as the device_name, trigger_pin, echo_pin, m, delta.

Known Issues:
1) We have to insert platform driver before platform device, otherwise we get a core dump
2) We have to wait for sometime before inserting the platform driver otherwise error is encountered
3) Attribute files are not being created in /sys/class/HCSR/. This is because the device is not added to HCSR class. 
	Searched for adding device to class (device_class, class_interface and class_simple) but these methods are not supported in for this kernel. 
	Also dug in to device_create for this kernel but to no avail.

Thank you
