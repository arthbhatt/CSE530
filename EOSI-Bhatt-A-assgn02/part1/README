Open a terminal and navigate to this (EOSI-Bhatt-A-assgn02/part1) folder

How to make?
Run the Makefile command to generate the binaries for kernel module and the test program
To run the Makefile, type "make" in the terminal after navigating to this folder.

How to run?
1) Copy the binaries(namely hcsr_drv.ko and hcsr_tester) to Intel Galileo Gen2 Board.
	Also copy the test_cases.sh file if you want to run that. 
	More information about this script is written in the Test-Cases section below.
   To copy, you can use the scp command. For example,
	scp hcsr_drv.ko hcsr_tester root@192.168.1.5:/home/root

2) Insert the kernel module using insmod
	insmod /home/root/hcsr_drv.ko
   This will create two device files in the /dev folder
   More number of devices can be created by using device_count parameter

3) Run hcsr_tester to test the device driver
	./hcsr_tester <device-file-path> ioctl 1 <trigger_pin> <echo_pin> --> To configure pins
	./hcsr_tester <device-file-path> ioctl 4 <number_samples> <sampling_period_in_ms> --> To set measurement parameters
	./hcsr_tester <device-file-path> write 0 --> To measure distance
	./hcsr_tester <device-file-path> write 1 --> To clear buffer and measure distance
	./hcsr_tester <device-file-path> read  --> To read the buffer

	Example:
		./hcsr_tester /dev/HCSR_0 ioctl 1 0 1
		./hcsr_tester /dev/HCSR_0 ioctl 4 4 100
		./hcsr_tester /dev/HCSR_0 write 0
		./hcsr_tester /dev/HCSR_0 read


To remove the driver, type "rmmod hcsr_drv.ko" in the terminal.

Test-Cases:
To successully run this script, make sure that the hcsr_tester and hcsr_drv.ko binaries are in the sample location.
Also make sure that the script is executable. If not, run chmod +x test_cases.sh .
Driver is insmoded by the script.
A test_cases.sh script is provided which runs some testcases.
It runs the userspace test program with some particular inputs.
At the start of the script, different parameters can be configure such as the device_name, trigger_pin, echo_pin, m, delta.

While running the testcases, you can also monitor the dmesg log to get some useful prints

Thank you
